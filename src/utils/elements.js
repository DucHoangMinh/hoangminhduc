  my_story: [
    'During my time in high school, I determined that my future career goal was to become an information technology engineer. And luckily, after the university entrance exam, I was admitted to the School of Information and Communications Technology at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.\n',
    'During the summer before entering my freshman year, I researched and learned my first programming language, C++. In my first year, alongside the general subjects program at school, I participated in classes with Mr. Tung Anh, a member of the programming club at the Vietnam Acad emy of Cryptography Techniques. Here, I learned about object-oriented programming with Java and how to use SQL Server databases. Thanks to that, I gained an initial understanding of programming work in general and the programming profession in particular.\n',
    'In my second year of university, I decided to pursue a career as a web programmer. So, I learned basic web programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the same time, I studied the ReactJS and NodeJS frameworks to build the backend of the website https://fullstack.edu.vn. I also learned to use other tools such as Git, Github, Docker, and Postman.\n' ,
    'At the end of my second year, I was accepted as a web programming intern at Otani U.P. Here, I learned and improved in many areas, from workflow to professional skills, including VueJS and Python Flask, Bitbucket, Docker, and more.\n' +
    'Currently, I am continuously working to enhance my knowledge and aiming to become a proficient programmer in the future.'
